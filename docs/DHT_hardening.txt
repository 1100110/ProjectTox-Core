List of possible attacks on the current DHT:

create thousands of fake nodes cloning one client_id and flood our DHT with 
them.

create thousands of "real" nodes that do nothing but shit up our DHT with fake 
crap.

...

Possible solutions:

Each client_id is the public key of the peer so it would be trivial to encrypt 
the DHT requests with crypto_box(). This would completely defeat the first 
attack.
